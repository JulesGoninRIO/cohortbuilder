Taxonomy
==========


Sometimes, some classifications are needed which are not readily available in the file metadata.
Cohort Builder uses its own classifiers based on image processing techniques to provide more details into files.

.. note::
    The current taxonomy module is not used and not maintained.
    The documentation is hence not updated.
